## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* changed Julia Silge's role to c("ctb", "rev") and added a comment for "rev".

* updated a broken link in the vignette.

## Test environments
* local Windows install, R 3.2.4
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.3
* win-builder (on appveyor-ci)
* Local OS X install of the package reviewer

## R CMD check results

R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* The Openstreetmap links are not invalid but they require login. They are part of the output of the package functions and appear in the vignette.

## Release summary

This is the first attempted CRAN release of opencage, and my first submission to CRAN.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
